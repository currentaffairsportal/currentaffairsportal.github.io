1. Protests erupted in **Hong Kong** after an announcementthat the National People’s Congress, China’s rubber-stamp parliament, would impose a national-security law on the territory. The demonstrations were also fuelled by a proposal in the city’s legislature to make insulting China’s national anthem a crime. Mike Pompeo, America’s secretary of state, said thatthe “facts on the ground” showed that Hong Kong was no longer autonomous. This could pave the way for American action, including possibly treating the territory the same as the rest of China fortrade and other purposes.

2. At the opening of the National People’s Congress in Beijing, the government abandoned a GDP **target** for the first time. The economy shrank by 6.8% in the first quarter.
